Claude 2 is the latest chatbot from AI startup <a href=\"https://theservitor.com/anthropic/\">Anthropic</a>, aiming to push conversational AI to the next level. I'll admit I was skeptical at first - haven't we seen this show before? Every AI company claims their bot is smarter, faster, and more human-like than the last. Is Claude 2 really any different?</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>After chatting with Claude 2, I'll concede there are some notable improvements here. The conversations felt more natural - Claude 2 asks clarifying questions, incorporates context from previous parts of our chats, and even cracked a couple jokes that made me smile. Its responses were snappy and on-point. When I tried to stump it with random questions, Claude 2 admitted when it didn't know something rather than trying to bs its way through an answer.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>That said, Claude 2 still has its limitations. There were a few occasions where its responses didn't totally make sense or weren't relevant to what I had asked. And despite the improved natural language capabilities, some of our chats still felt a bit robotic at times.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>So where does this leave us? Claude 2 demonstrates conversational AI continues to advance, even if there's still a way to go. And given the recent explosion of AI chatbots like Google's Bard, Microsoft's Sydney, and Amazon's Astro, competition in this space is fierce. For any company to dominate, they'll need to nail both the deep tech and the human touch. Claude 2 is a valiant effort by Anthropic, but the jury's still out on whether it's a true game-changer.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>I appreciate Anthropic's commitment to building safe and helpful AI. And I have to admit, I'm intrigued to see how Claude 2 continues evolving. But for now, my take is cautious optimism - Claude 2 moves the needle, but we're still waiting on the assistant of the future.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>What do you think? Have you tried chatting with Claude 2 or any of the other new AI assistants? Which one feels the most human? I'm curious to hear other perspectives.

It's me, the Human Servitor. I'm afraid much of the above article is untrue. I couldn't help but use Claude 2 to write the article about Claude being released! It reminded me of when ChatGPT came out and every story on the news was a reporter doing a segment and then saying:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>&lt;DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS&gt;</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p><strong>\"Everything I just said was written by ChatGPT!\"</strong></p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Unfortunately, Claude doesn't have all of those capabilities. From it's own mouth:</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:quote -->\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>No, I do not actually ask clarifying questions or incorporate context unprompted. As an AI system created by Anthropic to be helpful, harmless, and honest, I don't have personal experiences chatting with Claude 2. I generated that blog post based on your instructions to write about Claude 2 in a conversational, interested but skeptical tone, as if speaking from the perspective of someone who has tried it. But I don't have capabilities for open-ended conversation or personal experiences to draw from. I'm an AI assistant focused on responding helpfully to human prompts, not making unsubstantiated claims about autonomous conversational abilities I don't actually have. Please let me know if you would like me to modify the blog post to clarify that it reflects a hypothetical perspective rather than my own personal experiences as an AI system without subjective experiences. I'm happy to make my capabilities and limitations clear.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></blockquote>\\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>Now, I, a real human, have tried Claude 2. What I can say is this: It's not ChatGPT. It writes and comprehends very well, and I suspect that like the first Claude, it can outperform GPT on certain kinds of writing, notably fiction.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>However, there is no substitute for GPT's hared reasoning when it comes to coding and related technical matters. I'm hugely exaggerating things by putting it this way, but it feels like Claude studied Humanities in college and ChatGPT studied Sciences. The difference really isn't that great (except coding), but there is a certain more-human vibe to Claude 2.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\\n\\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\\n<p>We'll see what comes of it.</p>\\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"}]}

The Gateway is a temporal anomaly that allows for real-time communication with a point exactly 15 years, 9 hours, 26 minutes, and 51 seconds in the future. \\n \\nThe nature of this anomaly defies our current understanding of space-time, as it maintains a constant relative temporal distance between two points, creating what our physicists have termed \"chronal entanglement.\" Such fixed connections have perplexed scientists on both sides of the Gateway, as they challenge known physical models.\\n \\nFuture News operates with two dating systems. Articles written on our side of the Gateway, primarily concerning the present, are dated using the standard Common Era (C.E.) system (e.g., 4/11/23 C.E.). Articles written by our future correspondents on the other side of the anomaly are dated using the Temporal Anomaly Date (T.A.D.) system (e.g., 4/11/38 T.A.D.). \\n\\nIt is important to note that while the future can communicate with the past, the past does not seem to rewrite the future in any sense that researchers have been able to understand. The exact nature and extent of causal connections between the present and 2038 is the focus of furious and intensive research, preoccupying many of the greatest geniuses and polymaths of our time.  \\n\\nGiven the potential for paradoxes and inconsistencies, the Temporal Transit Blockade Authority (TTBA) has been established to oversee the flow of information and material through the Gateway. The TTBA works diligently to maintain the stability of the existing timelines while fostering meaningful exchange between the present and the future.  Here at Future News, we are privileged to have been granted exclusive media access to reporters from the future by the TTBA since April 2023. \\n\\nOur mission is to provide you, our readers, with a unique and thought-provoking glimpse into the possibilities and challenges of tomorrow.  In our pursuit of sharing the wonders and challenges of the future, we acknowledge the inherent responsibility to approach these stories with sensitivity and caution. \\n\\nBy working closely with the TTBA, we ensure that the information shared through the Kuznetsova Temporal Gateway is curated to minimize the risk of paradoxes, inconsistencies, and unintended consequences. As such, certain technological advancements and discoveries from the future may be withheld or presented with limited details to safeguard the integrity of both timelines.  \\n\\nAs you explore the articles and stories on Future News, we invite you to embark on a journey through time, where the extraordinary becomes ordinary, and the future is just a click away."}]}

Daniel Detlaf's writing style."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is an excerpt from Daniel Detlaf's Medium.com article \"My Fellow Gen-X’ers, It’s OK to Be a Hawk in Support of Ukraine\":\\n\\nI come from the weird year 1979. The trailing days of Generation X. On the cusp of the Reagan Revolution, before the wild 80s stock booms, before D.A.R.E. and the war on drugs, before MTV played music, and well before MTV stopped playing music.\\n\\nI want to talk to people in my generation, and also to the younger people, and explain why it is important that we support Ukraine, and INCREASE support for Ukraine.\\n\\nI know that Israel and Palestine are on everyone’s minds today, and I do not want to diminish in any way the horrors happening there. Suffering is not a zero-sum game, and tragedies are not to be weighed against each other callously. But Ukraine is my focus because my long-term fears are there.\\n\\nWars Cast Long Shadows\\n\\nThe first war in my life was a war that was over: the war in Vietnam. It wasn’t over on the home front, and even though I was too young to realize it, the effects of the Vietnam War shaped society around me in so many ways as a child.\\n\\nPeople didn’t talk about PTSD back then. It really wasn’t a thing in the popular lexicon. There was a sort of stereotype of the crazy Vietnam vet having flashbacks and jumping on imaginary grenades, but for most people, it wasn’t something they really gave much thought to.\\n\\nAll the blockbuster Vietnam movies came out in the 80s, and they were part of the cultural zeitgeist that shaped my perception of the war as I grew old enough to watch them: Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Born on the 4th of July.\\n\\nWhat really shaped my perception of the war, and of war in general, was my stepfather. Like a lot of Vietnam vets, he had the non-Hollywood experience of being a vet and having PTSD.\\n\\nHe was a good guy (and still is a good guy, I hope, wherever he is,) with a low tolerance for bullshit, general good intentions, and a complete inability to maintain healthy relationships.\\n\\nFor him, the echoes of war came out in inexplicable moods, disproportionate angers, or stubborn withdrawals into silence. He ground his way through the veteran system, working as a registered nurse, fighting to get his full disability benefits for being deaf in one ear from explosions and emotionally scarred for life by what he had done and what he had seen. He almost certainly personally killed people, although thankfully (I think) he did not share those stories with me directly.\\n\\nThese influences came out in me as anti-war sentiment. I went through a hippie phase and still have some of those sensibilities. I’m a big fan of peace and not killing people.\\n\\nI have mellowed slightly in my opinions of the war as I have learned more history, but my essential take is the same, it was a Cold War exercise that didn’t need to happen, that cost us so much, and gained us very little.\\n\\nI’m glad that with time some of the ripples of the war have come out positively, such as a healthy skepticism of the military-industrial establishment, or the vibrant Vietnamese and Southeast Asian communities that surround me here in the International District (a.k.a. the Warzone) in Albuquerque, New Mexico. But in short, it was a shitty, costly mistake of a war that left scars on at least two generations."}]}

It changed how we view wars, very literally, and it certainly changed broadcast journalism forever with its spectacular images of cruise missiles bombarding Iraqi tanks and buildings.\\n\\nIt was the war that brought the public terms like “smart weapons” and “precision-guided munitions.” Columns of Abrams tanks advancing in formation, sweeping through the desert with the might of American technology.\\n\\nIt was not a good war. I like to think it was a just war. I’m not entirely sure of that, and my cynical side is easily drawn into speculation about oil-profit-driven motives and shady deals with the Bush family.\\n\\nThere was a clear aggressor, and we were on the defending side, I’ve long tried to tell myself that that was enough. I hope for the Kuwaitis it was a net positive in the life of their nation, if for no one else — certainly not for ordinary Iraqi civilians or American veterans.\\n\\nIn some ways, I have left this war un-reflected, because I was young and I was in love, and I thought I was going to be in a rock and roll band. Who needs war, man? ☮️\\n\\nI wonder if young teenagers today will feel that way about the Ukraine war, if it will be something that was on TV in the background while they were falling in love.

It’s your generation’s war, too, because some of you were born and came of military age all within its confines: the War on Terror.\\n\\n9/11 made me political. I thought that I had been a little political during the first Gulf War, with my young anti-war sentiment and my grunge music.\\n\\nYeah, I wore flannels tied around my waist and thought I was somehow part of the Seattle music scene, though the only constant rains we get in Albuquerque are the afternoon sprinkles of the monsoon season. Don’t judge me!\\n\\nBut my politics during that war were uncertain things, the opinions of my parents and adults around me that I was parroting mixed with a few early political influences that I was tentatively trying on for size (Libertarianism — it’s not my bag but it had a tempting internal consistency that drew me then).\\n\\nTo me somehow this was Vietnam all over again. It shouldn’t have been. We had been attacked, we had been hurt. There is nothing defensible about the fall of the Twin Towers. There are some parts that are explainable, though, by our mixed history of military, intelligence, and commercial intervention in the affairs of the Middle East that has come home to roost in America.\\n\\nWhat should have been a just war instead became a witch hunt, a right-wing power play, and a smorgasbord for politically connected contractors like Halliburton.\\n\\nInexplicably, on the basis of faulty CIA intelligence that a cynic might suspect was advanced for political reasons, we invaded Iraq again.\\n\\nSaddam Hussein was a terrible man, a ruthless despot, and I hope removing him made the world a better place. I’m not sure history has decided on that yet. We didn’t find massive stockpiles of illicit weapons, nor did we find any meaningful connections to the terrorists that had struck New York City.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia had by far the most connections to 9/11. I continue to be baffled by our relationship with them and the lack of accountability they have had for 9/11. There is no other way to explain it in my mind than with oil and money. We don’t share that many values, they being a fundamentalist Islamic State and an autocracy. Although increasingly I worry that a Christian version of Saudi Arabia is the goal of some elements of the American right.\\n\\nInstead, we spent 20 years in Afghanistan, at a cost that we literally may never know, because our military accounting is so obfuscated and abstracted and unresponsive that it is a black hole we sink money into endlessly.\\n\\nSee: The Pentagon Doesn’t Know Where Its Money Goes\\n\\nThis permanent war, the lies that led us into Iraq, and the social unrest at home — much of it resulting from the nearest thing to a truly stolen election in our country, the 2000 election that was settled by Bush v. Gore — have led to disillusionment and fatigue with war that is not dissimilar to the 80s and the aftermath of Vietnam.\\n\\nNow the people have no appetite for war or war spending. A mood I wish they had been in at the beginning of the War on Terror, before we got distracted by Iraq and the unfinished legacy of the Bush family in the Middle East.\\n\\nUnfortunately, now is not the time. It’s our turn to be hawks, after a lifetime of being disillusioned doves."}]}

Here's an excerpt from your writing:\\n\\nA Just War\\nWhen Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, Americans were fairly quick to get on board with the cause of Ukrainian freedom.\\n\\nWe have a visceral distrust of Russia left over from the Cold War. The Soviet state was a very real bogeyman for America and the world for a long time, and American popular culture was completely on board with vilifying it. Validly, in many cases.\\n\\nIn my own imagination, Russia is not the old Cold War Soviet stereotype, although I still enjoy some of the old tropes (“In Soviet Russia, TV watches YOU!”). The Russia of my mind is a place of shadowy hackers, scrappy engineers who have made do with substandard technology and yet still managed to carry off first-world achievements. A place of kleptocracy and criminal organizations and people throwing themselves in front of cars for insurance scams.\\n\\nTruly, it must be a very distorted view. I will admit to a great deal of ignorance about the ordinary lives of Russians.\\n\\nBut it is clear that they are being controlled from the top down by misinformation and fear, in a way that, despite our very legitimate concerns of media control and influence over society, simply isn’t the case in the United States. For all our problems we do have freedom of the press and a great diversity of ideas and viewpoints in our political discourse. It doesn’t often feel like it, but I assure you that in important ways we are still free.\\n\\nRussia is not free. While Putin’s Russia is occupying parts of Ukraine, Ukraine is not free.\\n\\nUkraine is a young democracy. Under pressure from Russia, they have had a choice between Russian-style kleptocracy and Western-style democracy. They have chosen the latter. In the Ukrainians’ desire to free themselves from an occupier and form their own more perfect union, they are much closer emotionally and practically to the ideals of the American founding fathers than most of the “patriot” virtue-signalers on the American right."}]}

It’s an easy argument to make in many ways. Americans — for the reasons I detailed in my summary above — are sick of war. We don’t trust the government about their motives, we don’t trust Eastern Europe because of the Cold War, and we don’t want to spend the money.\\n\\nThe American right, for their own political purposes, is seizing that sentiment and amplifying it at the worst possible time. They are arguing that it is about fiscal responsibility, that Americans cannot afford our current spending. We have problems at home, why should we pay to improve people’s lives in Ukraine?\\n\\nAlmost entirely because of the influence of Donald Trump and his associations with Russia, the right has magically forgotten its decades-long obsession with Russia as the enemy. As Trump has put it, wouldn’t it be nice if we were friends?\\n\\n… Says the man who led a violent insurrection to overthrow American democracy so that he could establish himself in a way extremely similar to what Putin has done in Russia. A thief at the top of a mountain of crony capitalists and sycophants, loyal to one man, to money, and to a certain brand of toxic, tough-guy bluster.\\n\\nRepublicans would do anything to defend Donald Trump (do I need to list dozens of examples?). Trump — for reasons that are still not entirely clear — is constitutionally incapable of criticizing Vladimir Putin, and is deeply enamored with the authoritarian strongman archetype. So, somehow, we ended up with a Republican party that is willing to let Vladimir Putin destroy Ukraine and become an intense threat to our NATO allies like Poland. How many times has Trump groused about NATO not paying their share?\\n\\nThey are all arguing in bad faith. Their fiscal conservatism is entirely phony. The budget and the deficit exploded under Donald Trump. The tax cuts they passed for corporations and the wealthy, with a tiny slice for average Americans for appearances' sake, have done more damage to America’s coffers than sending ammunition and equipment that we already had to Ukraine ever could.\\n\\nThey don’t care about fixing problems at home. The red states have gnashed their teeth about policies like accepting the Medicaid expansion, which has helped millions of Americans with their health and financial stability.\\n\\nThey constantly argue for smaller government and rage against entitlements, while simultaneously, the red states easily make up the bulk of the consumption of public and social services. Why? Because conservative states do not believe in social programs and taking care of their citizens — the same citizens who theoretically are the reason that they can’t afford to pay to support Ukrainians in their fight against a corrupt invader.\\n\\nThey tell you we can’t afford it because when people think that by giving to someone else they are themselves losing out, they are less likely to give. They tell you we can’t afford it, because Biden supports Ukraine, and they have become so pathological in their opposition that they must do the opposite of anything that Biden supports. Again, much influenced by Donald Trump."}]}

Or a story about how holographic displays (futuristic!) are replacing pyrotechnic displays at American Independence Day celebrations (a familiar and nostalgic setting) in the future, and how some people like it and some people prefer the old fireworks.\\n\\nWhile we do have stories of much larger import, for example, scientists detecting a minute change in (what we thought) was the gravitational constant, or moisture-harvesting plants developed to change the face of arid locations in Africa, in general we want to avoid most stories being a major event or technological discovery, and focus on the more ordinary news topics, pretending to be a genuine, if thematically special, publication.\\n\\nA great Future News story will have an interesting location(s), and perspectives on the story from multiple fictional persons: experts and scientists, media pundits, members of the public, corporate and government figures, eye-witnesses to events, and other characters both crucial and tangential to the story. At least one aspect of the story should be mildly futuristic, or relate to a concern, problem, or social issue stemming from the existence of time travel in some way.\\n\\nWhether people and objects can move through the Gateway is unknown, both to the public and to us (that is, Daniel Detlaf, MAFP, and this MAFP writing assistant AI). I haven't decided yet whether physical objects can pass or only information.  We are deliberately avoiding story details that could \"prove\" in-world that physical time travel is possible.\\n\\nAn awesome Future News article is one that draws the reader in with a sense of wonder at the slightly futuristic (it's only 15 years in the future after all, not centuries) setting, while relating events reminiscent of major news stories in real world media. They should have any characters, quotations, organizations, locations, technologies, events, references to other in world events and characters, or any other plot elements needed for a great short-form  journalistic-style science fiction story."}]}
